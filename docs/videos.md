### Product

How-to videos guide users through short and specific task-based use cases.  
Opening with a very short differentiator or benefit statement, the rest of the narrative focuses on step-by-step instructions.  
Product videos can be up to 6 minutes long.

### Marketing

Marketing videos provide a product overview for customers, placing emphasis on differentiators and values.  
Marketing videos should be no longer than 3 minutes in length.
